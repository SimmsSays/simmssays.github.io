With the help of my friends, each week on this blog I’ve tried to tackle some of the major parts of a uni student’s life but recently this has gone to pot. In the midst of this pandemic, productivity and motivation are things that a lot of people are lacking, whilst anxiety is at an all time high. This week I’d like to talk about some of the things I’ve learnt during this time about life and the important things that make it up.

**Self-care** is a big one and something I’ve majorly neglected, during one of the worst times. For me, looking after myself and making myself feel good, equates to how motivated I feel. When I neglect the basic things that usually make me feel like a human, whether that’s putting on my favourite outfit or looking in the mirror and not feeling like a total scruff, how I look on the outside can have a major effect on my mental health. This morning for the first time in weeks I put on some simple make-up and just doing something that makes me feel normal, has a massive impact on how I feel. After a good cup of coffee and getting dressed, I feel much more ready to tackle my uni work than I have in weeks.

Through a hard time like this, **friendships** are something that really get you through. I’ve realised the people I want to make time for, and the people that want to make time for me. I think it’s important to remember that everyone is struggling in some way, everyone has lost things during this time but friendships shouldn’t be one of them. I’ve always had a strong sense of who is important in my life, but at times like these you really realise. Check in with that friend who’s feeling especially lonely, set up a coffee date with your best friend, and let people know that you’re there for them.

I can imagine that a lot of uni students have moved back home sooner than they anticipated and I am one of them. I’m very close to my mum and would usually call her everyday or very frequently whilst I was at uni. I was never particularly homesick but I’ve always counted my mum as one of my best friends. However, **moving home** has been a big adjustment. With uni, comes a lot of freedom and I’ve become so used to doing things on my own terms that living with my 16 year old brother, mum and three dogs (who I’m pretty sure I’m allergic to) basically in captivity, has been a big struggle. It’s an adjustment for all of us and it takes finding a rhythm of finding time for yourself whilst constantly being in each other's space. I have all my meals with my family, we might watch a film or go for a walk, but I also spend time in my room practicing my ukulele or settle in the dining room to get on my work. It's just about finding that balance and not feeling bad for wanting to have some time for yourself.

I’ve also realised that I value **experience** a lot more than ‘stuff’. I’m usually one of these people that buys a lot of unnecessary things and clothes, but I would give it up all of these objects just to be able to go for a coffee and a catch up in a cute little cafe with my friends again. I’ve also decided the decision to apply for my masters this year which I was going to leave for a year and come back to, which has added a lot more workload on my shoulders but I think it’s something I need to do. A lot of people that do a masters are said to do it just for the sake of it, but it’s something I’ve always wanted to and look forward to. But this takes time and money, so I’ve got to get my butt into action. This blog post was the first thing on my to-do list today so that's the first step.
