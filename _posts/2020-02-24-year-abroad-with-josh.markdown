Josh is a third-year law student, who is currently studying on a **year-abroad** in Vienna. In this Q & A he talks about his experiences and shares a **positive outlook** on stepping outside of his comfort zone, and trying something new. During his time at university, he has made a great group of friends, became a committee member of a law society, and has loved the city he has predominantly studied in, so taking on a year abroad wasn’t something you would necessarily expect him to do. But, he has embraced this rare opportunity, and he's thriving...

**Q:** Have you always wanted to go on a year abroad?

**A:** In short, yes. My university has one of the largest selection of places one can go on a year abroad of any of the law schools in the country and that is naturally used as a big selling point on open days. As such the idea of a year abroad and the benefits of going on one, are instilled in you from before you have even started university.
Likewise, law is one of the more competitive professions, so doing anything to set you apart is pivotal. Outside of academia and job prospects, there is also interest in just getting to know another culture, language and system of study. There are few times in your life where you can do this as easily as you can now, so it makes sense to be interested.


**Q:** Did you have any hesitations?

**A:** I think everyone will have hesitations when they’re moving their life hundreds, if not thousands, of kilometres away. In reality, I didn’t think it was too different to how I felt going to university: you’re worried about who you’re going to meet; will you make friends; what will your accommodation be like etc. But these are natural. You do also worry about staying in touch with friends, but if you can manage it moving from school to university then the practicalities are basically the same and you work around it as best as you can. If they’re your friends they will stay in touch regardless of where you are.


**Q:** How did you decide where you wanted to go?

**A:** My decision was primarily based on the fact that I could speak German and wanted to improve that. I also didn’t want to travel too far from home for personal reasons, but this wasn’t as pressing. At the time there was only one German speaking destination, Vienna, and that is where I ended up going. That being said, you still are conscious of other matters, in particularly the cost of living, the price/distance for flight homes, and what you can do in the area around where you are.


**Q:** How was the settling in process?

**A:** Very straightforward. There were so many events to make sure you know the university, city and each other. So, there is no real difficulty in settling in. There is also, at least for Erasmus schemes, a coordinator to whom you can always turn if you have questions or queries about how things are being done. Likewise, you still are in constant contact with your home University who also still take care of you so no real worries whatsoever.


**Q:** What are some of your highlights from your year abroad?

**A:** The biggest highlight has to be the people you meet. The sheer breadth of diversity in cultures and backgrounds is breath-taking and something from which you can learn an awful lot. Viewed through this lens you learn so much more than just that for which you have gone on a year abroad. The vast array of subjects I’ve been able to study, despite just doing law modules, has been amazing. This has taken me personally to the UN in Vienna, but I know others have been able to go further afield to Prague or Jerusalem.


**Q:**  How do you keep up contact with people from back home?

**A:** Various ways: Facebook Messenger, Snapchat, WhatsApp and phone call are the most common ways I do and pretty much everyone I know does it.


**Q:** What advice would you give someone wanting to study abroad?

**A:** **Everything you do go in with an open mind**. This is whether it’s the modules you’re doing or the people you’re meeting; things are obviously different to the UK.. A lot of people also say you need to be really sure you want to go before you do. I don’t think this is quite true, some doubt is natural and arguably helpful as it means you have tempered expectations and are more prepared in the event that there is an issue. You’re literally moving your life to a new country; any doubt is very natural.
