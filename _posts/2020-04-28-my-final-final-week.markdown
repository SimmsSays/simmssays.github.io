I was going to write a very doom and gloom piece about my final week of university but decided that rambling on about that for 500 words or so, wouldn’t be enjoyable for anyone. Instead, this week’s blog is going to be on 7 things I’ve found enjoyable during lockdown. After 6 weeks or so being stuck at home, I’ve managed to find some small things that make the days count a little bit more.


**FaceTime with my Friends**

Having something to look forward to, whether I’ve planned it a week in advance or on the day, is really important for me. After the initial worried chats about what’s going to happen in the future and what’s going on in the news, FaceTiming my friends regularly keeps me sane and are a few hours in the day where I can just chill and talk about nonsense.

**Baking**

Like everyone else it seems, I’ve taken up baking, from slightly sunken blueberry muffins to a half-decent banana bread. After my creation has been baked, my mum and I sit down with a coffee and that week’s cake, resembling a make-shift Costa. One of the things I miss the most, is a cosy coffee shop, so my version will have to do for the time being.

**Reading**

It’s taken me awhile to get back into reading, partly due to my current inability to focus on anything, but I finally managed to finish a book, for what seems like months. I’m currently trying to make my way through the Women’s Prize Longlist, because I think it’s a great way to read a variety of literature and allows me to feel like I’m reading towards a goal. I’ve already read _[Girl, Woman, Other][d2c7661a]_, which I would recommend to anyone who appreciates a carefully crafted story, and have recently devoured _[Weather][c349e48e]_, which feels so timely and really resonated with me. I’m currently reading _[How we Disappeared][5b45d1d0]_ which I haven’t quite got into the rhythm of yet, but think it’s worth pursuing. I try to order my books from a variety of different places to help support the book trade, splitting up my orders between Waterstones, Blackwell's and my local indie shop.

**[Jay’s Virtual Pub Quiz][bf758279]**

I am always partial to a pub quiz, and really enjoyed going to my local pub with my friends, shoutout to the brilliant quiz master Dave at the Angel and Greyhound. Now, every Thursday night, my mum and I get the ciders in, put some crisps in a bowl and tune in to arguably the best virtual pub quiz around. Spectacularly, we seem to score less than the previous week, every week, but it’s something that we look forward to and enjoy, and brings some sense of normalcy back into our lives.

**The Ukulele**

For my birthday a few months ago, my brother randomly bought me a ukulele. At the time I was a bit sceptical, but now it’s been a great way to chill in my room and take a break from my screen. I’ve learned the basic chords and just practice for an hour or so a day, so next stop… complete ukulele stardom!

**Spending with my Family**

I’m quite close with my family anyway, with it just being my mum and my younger brother, but living full time with them again has certainly been an adjustment. Now we’ve got into the swing of things, and lessons have been learnt in knocking on people’s doors and letting them have space, we’ve found a breathable routine. Knowing that this is the last year I will (hopefully) be living at home, I want to appreciate this time where I don’t have to ring them for a chat, but can just walk into the other room.

**Applying for an MA**

For a long time now, I’ve wanted to pursue a master’s degree in English Literature and had decided to postpone applying till next year. Even though that’s still the plan, I’ve decided to apply now and defer, so I feel like I’m working towards something if I ever feel a bit lost during my year out. My plan is to save up and work to actually afford being able to live during postgrad, but I feel a lot more motivated now. I’ve had time to think about what I want to do with my life and even though I’m still not entirely sure, I know that studying English is something I definitely want to do. So fingers crossed, I actually get in!
