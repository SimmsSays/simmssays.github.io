- Social Distancing
---
For this week's post it only seemed to fitting to stage an interview with myself, in honour of these times of social distancing. Everyday there are peaks and troughs and whether you live alone, or with housemates or your family, it is easy to feel lonely in these times of never-ending news and panic. For our NHS workers and those working in critical roles such as supermarkets, social distancing isn't a choice they can afford, but the rest of us, it is a necessity. So, over to me...


Q: How do you feel about social distancing?

A: As a self-confessed introvert, the thought of staying in doors surrounded by my books and the recently purchased Disney +, I wasn't as horrified by the thought of it as some people may be. Up until very recently I was still living in my uni house but had booked to go home, months prior to the Coronavirus outbreak. Compared to my uni house, my family home is quite a lot smaller, so I was a little bit anxious about being cooped up in such small confinements, but so far it hasn't been too bad. Like a lot of final-year students it's difficult to get my head around the fact that I will never go back to uni like it's another day of the semester or spend my final months in Oxford surrounded by my friends, which may seem superficial, but still a sad truth. I think everyday will have peaks and troughs, but we just have to accept the fact that this is the new, temporary normal.


Q: What do you plan to do with this time?

A:
