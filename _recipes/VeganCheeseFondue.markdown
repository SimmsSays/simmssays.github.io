### Makes 2 servings
### Prep Time: 5 minutes
### Cook Time: 10 minutes
### Total Time: 15 minutes

## Ingredients
### For the Fondue
- 3/4 cup white wine
- 3/4 cup nutritional yeast
- 1/2 cup vegetable broth
- 3/4 cup unsweetened almond or soy milk
- 1 tablespoon white miso paste
- 1 clove of garlic, minced
- 1-2 tablespoons mustard
- 1 teaspoon tahini
- 1 pinch pepper
- 1 pinch salt
- 1 pinch nutmeg
- 4 tablespoons flour

### For Dipping
- Recommended: a hot baguette



## Method
1. Put all ingredients (except for the flour) in a pot and cook for about 5 minutes.
2. Then stir in the flour and wait until it all thickens up.
3. If it's too thick add some more plant-based milk. If it's too thin add more flour.
4. When it's ready, you can either transfer it to a caquelon or just use a regular bowl instead.
5. However, it's better to use a real fondue pot, a so-called caquelon, as it keeps the cheese sauce hot.
