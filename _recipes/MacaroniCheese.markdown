## Cook Time: 35 minutes
## Total Time: 50 minutes


## Ingredients
- 1 medium cauliflower, cut into florets
- 1 carrot, chopped
- 6 garlic cloves
- 3 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 cups macaroni pasta or pasta of your choice
- 1 cup almond milk
- 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar
- 1 tablespoon white miso
- 1/3 cup vegan cream cheese
- 1/4 cup nutritional yeast
- 1/2 cup raw cashews
- 1/4 teaspoon red cayenne pepper
- 1 teaspoon smoked paprika
- 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1/4 teaspoon turmeric
- 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
- 2 tablespoons dry mint leaf flakes
- 1 teaspoon sea salt
- 2 tablespoons vegan butter


## Method
1. Set the oven 400Â°F.
2. Place the cauliflower florets and the carrots into an oven dish, add two tablespoons of the olive oil and mix.
3. Wrap the garlic cloves in aluminum foil together with the remainder of the olive oil.
4. Oven roast the vegetables and the garlic for about 25-30 minutes.
5. In the meantime, cook the pasta according to package directions, drain, and set aside.
6. In a high-speed blender, blend the roasted cauliflower and carrot mix, the roasted garlic, and all the other ingredients except the macaroni and the vegan butter. Blend until you get a very smooth mixture.
7. For a more cheesy taste, let this sauce wait at room temperature for one to two hours.
8. Add the vegan butter and the macaroni pasta in a large pan, stir and cook for about one minute until the butter melts and the macaroni is coated uniformly. Add the cheese sauce, stir and cook for about 5 more minutes.
