## Prep Time: 30 minutes
## Cook Time: 5 minutes
## Total Time: 35 minutes

## Ingredients:

### Cashew Mozzarella:
- 1/2 cup raw cashews, soaked for 2 hours or overnight
- 1/2 cup almond milk
- 2 tsp tapioca starch
- 1 tsp cornstarch or arrowroot starch
- 1/4 tsp agar powder
- 1/2 tsp fine sea salt
- 1/2 tsp apple cider vinegar
- 1/2 tsp lemon juice
- 1 tsp nutritional yeast
- 2 tsp extra virgin olive oil
- 1 Tbsp vegan butter (or evoo)
- a generous pinch of kala namak (black salt)
- a generous pinch of onion powder
- 1/4 tsp pepper flakes

### Breading
- 1/4 cup flour

### Breading Wet
- 1/4 cup water
- 1/4 cup almond milk
- 2 Tbsp flour
- 1 Tbsp flaxmeal
- 1/4 tsp each of garlic powder, salt, smoked paprika

### Breading Dry
- 1/2 cup bread crumbs
- 1/4 tsp each of salt, red pepper flakes, black pepper
- 1/2 tsp italian herb blend (oregano, basil, thyme, rosemary)


## Method
### Make the Mozzarella:
- Blend everything under mozzarella into a smooth puree. Taste and adjust salt and tang if needed.
- Pour into a pan and cook at medium heat, stirring frequently to avoid burning, for 8-10 minutes until the mixture is really thick and starts to leave the pan (or is at a soft lightly sticky dough stage).
- Grease a small bread pan or other pan with extra virgin olive oil and drop the mozzarella in it.
- Even it out using a spatula.
- Cool completely, cover the pan and Let set in the refrigerator for an hour or more.

### Set up the Breading station when ready to bake:
- Keep flour in one plate.
- Mix everything under Breading Wet in a bowl.
- Mix everything under Breading Dry in another deep plate or bowl.
- Remove the cheese from the pan and slice the Mozzarella into about 1/4 inch thin slices.
- Keep the slices small since the breading is going to increase the size by 2 or 3 times.
- Roll each slice in flour.
- Then dip it in the wet mixture, then dip in the breadcrumbs to coat well.
- Place on parchment lined sheet. Bread all the slices and freeze for 10 minutes.

## Time to Bake!
- Freeze the breaded mozzarella for 15 minutes.
- Pre-heat the oven to 450 degrees.
- Remove moxy sticks from freezer, spray oil or brush oil on the sticks.
- Bake for 4 minutes.
- Move the sheet to the top level of the oven and broil for 1 minute or until the breading starts to brown.  
- Remove and serve immediately. Enjoy!
