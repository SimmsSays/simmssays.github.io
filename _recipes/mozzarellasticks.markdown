### Prep Time: 30 minutes
### Cook Time: 5 minutes
### Total Time: 35 minutes

## Ingredients:

### Cashew Mozzarella:
- 1/2 cup raw cashews, soaked for 2 hours or overnight
- 1/2 cup almond milk
- 2 tsp tapioca starch
- 1 tsp cornstarch or arrowroot starch
- 1/4 tsp agar powder
- 1/2 tsp fine sea salt
- 1/2 tsp apple cider vinegar
- 1/2 tsp lemon juice
- 1 tsp nutritional yeast
- 2 tsp extra virgin olive oil
- 1 Tbsp vegan butter (or evoo)
- a generous pinch of kala namak (black salt)
- a generous pinch of onion powder
- 1/4 tsp pepper flakes

### Breading
- 1/4 cup flour

### Breading Wet
- 1/4 cup water
- 1/4 cup almond milk
- 2 Tbsp flour
- 1 Tbsp flaxmeal
- 1/4 tsp each of garlic powder, salt, smoked paprika

### Breading Dry
- 1/2 cup bread crumbs
- 1/4 tsp each of salt, red pepper flakes, black pepper
- 1/2 tsp italian herb blend (oregano, basil, thyme, rosemary)


## Method
### Make the Mozzarella:
1. Blend everything under mozzarella into a smooth puree. Taste and adjust salt and tang if needed.
2. Pour into a pan and cook at medium heat, stirring frequently to avoid burning, for 8-10 minutes until the mixture is really thick and starts to leave the pan (or is at a soft lightly sticky dough stage).
3. Grease a small bread pan or other pan with extra virgin olive oil and drop the mozzarella in it.
4. Even it out using a spatula.
5. Cool completely, cover the pan and Let set in the refrigerator for an hour or more.

### Set up the Breading station when ready to bake:
1. Keep flour in one plate.
2. Mix everything under Breading Wet in a bowl.
3. Mix everything under Breading Dry in another deep plate or bowl.
4. Remove the cheese from the pan and slice the Mozzarella into about 1/4 inch thin slices.
5. Keep the slices small since the breading is going to increase the size by 2 or 3 times.
6. Roll each slice in flour.
7. Then dip it in the wet mixture, then dip in the breadcrumbs to coat well.
8. Place on parchment lined sheet. Bread all the slices and freeze for 10 minutes.

## Time to Bake!
1. Freeze the breaded mozzarella for 15 minutes.
2. Pre-heat the oven to 450 degrees.
3. Remove mozzarella sticks from freezer, spray oil or brush oil on the sticks.
4. Bake for 4 minutes.
5. Move the sheet to the top level of the oven and broil for 1 minute or until the breading starts to brown.  
6. Remove and serve immediately. Enjoy!
