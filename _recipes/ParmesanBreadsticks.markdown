### Makes 12 breadsticks
### Prep Time: 20 minutes
### Cook Time: 12 minutes
### Total Time: 32 minutes


## Ingredients
- 1 packet active dry yeast
- 1 tbsp cane sugar
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 1 tsp sea salt
- 2 1/2-3 cups unbleached all-purpose flour or whole-wheat pastry flour
- 3 Tbsp vegan-friendly basil pesto (see recipe below)
- 3-4 Tbsp vegan parmesan cheese

### Vegan Pesto:
- 2 cups fresh basil
- 1/3 cup raw walnuts or pine nuts
- 1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil
- 4 large cloves garlic (chopped)
- 1 healthy pinch (1/4 tsp) each sea salt and black pepper
- 3 tbsp vegan parmesan cheese (or substitute 2 tbsp nutritional yeast, or omit)
- 1 tbsp lemon juice


## Method
- To make the pesto, add all ingredients to a food processor and mix until combined, leaving a little texture.
- Taste and adjust seasonings as needed.
- Store covered in the fridge for up to a couple weeks, though best when fresh. Freeze for longer term storage.

1. For the breadsticks, add 1 cup warm water – 110 degrees (43 C) or about the temp of bath water – to a large mixing bowl.
2. Make sure it’s not too hot or it will kill the yeast.
3. Sprinkle on yeast and let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes.
4. Add the sugar, oil, salt and stir.
5. Using a wooden spoon, slowly add the flour and mix until a dough ball forms. You may not be able to add all 3 cups of flour, so add a little at a time until it won’t accept anymore (amount as original recipe is written // refer to the higher end of the range if altering batch size). You will likely add in more while kneading.
6. Transfer dough to a lightly floured surface and knead by hand for 30 seconds to 1 minute, or until a smooth ball comes together.
7. Wipe out your mixing bowl and add 1 Tbsp olive oil (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size).
8. Add dough back in, flipping a couple times to cover with oil, leaving the seam side down.
9. Cover with plastic wrap and set aside in a warm place for about an hour. The dough should double in size (see photo).
10. Cut the dough in half. Reserve one half for later use. Will freeze for up to 3 months, or stay in the fridge for a few days.
11. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (232 C).
12. On a floured surface, roll the remaining half of the dough out into a rectangle about 1/4 inch thick.
13. Carefully transfer to a parchment lined baking sheet, reforming it into a rectangle.
14. Leaving the edges bare, generously brush with vegan pesto and top with an even layer of vegan parmesan cheese.
15. Bake for 11 – 13 minutes or until the crust and cheese are golden brown. Slice and serve immediately.
