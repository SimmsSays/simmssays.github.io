# Vegan Cream Cheese Swirl Cookies
Although the title of the dish might be a mouthful, it's certainly a delicous one! Incorporating cream cheese into cookies may seem rather rogue, the flavours compliment eachother nicely. Have a swirl!

## Makes 15 servings

## Prep Time: 20 minutes
## Cook Time: 12 minutes
## Total Time: 32 minutes

## Ingredients
- 4 tablespoons unsalted vegan margarine room temp
- 3 ounces vegan cream cheese softened
- 1 cup sugar
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- ½ teaspoon salt

## Method
1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
2. Butter and flour a cookie sheet or cover the cookie sheet with parchment paper.
3. Using an electric mixer, cream together the butter, cream cheese and sugar until light and fluffy, about 3-5 minutes.
4. Mix in flour and salt, until just incorporated.
5. Get a large decorating bag and cut the tip of the bag to make room for your largest star tip.
6. Put the bag with the tip attached into a large water glass, and fold the top of the bag over the glass. About 3 inches should fold over the glass. Fill the bag with batter. You will have much more batter than will fit into the bag at once, so pipe in batches. Only fill the bag ½-3/4 full!
7. Pipe the Pastry in swirls onto your buttered and floured baking sheet. Freeze swirls in freezer for 15-20 minutes to help them hold their shape while baking.
8. The cookies will spread a little bit as they bake so I recommend swirls 1.5 in - 2 in in diameter.
9. Bake for 12 minutes. The cookies are ready when the edges and bottoms are golden brown.
10. Let cool on baking sheet for a few minutes. Then remove cookies from baking sheet using a spatula, and let them cool completely on a cooling rack. They also taste great warm!
