## Ingredients
### For the Lentil Bolognese Sauce:
- 1 250g can of whole peeled plum tomatoes, no salt added
- 1 cup of green or brown lentils, rinsed and sorted
- 1/2 of 250g bag frozen peppers and onions
- 4 cups vegetable broth
- 15 strained tomatoes
- 6 large garlic cloves, crushed
- 2 tablespoons maple syrup
- 1 tablespoon dried oregano
- 1 tablespoon dried basil
- 1/2 tablespoon dried parsley
- 2 teaspoons fine sea salt
- 1/2 teaspoon garlic granules
- 1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper

### For the lasagne:
- 1 10-ounce box uncooked gluten-free lasagne
- 8 cups lentil bolognese sauce
- 2 cups cashew cheese
- 1/4 cup vegan Parmesan cheese
- 2 cups packed of baby spinach/ kale
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1 teaspoon dried basil
- 1 cup vegan Mozzarella cheese, shredded


## Method
### For the Lentil Bolognese:
1. Add can of whole tomatoes to rice cooker. Use the edge of a long handled spoon to break the tomatoes apart into chunks.
2. Add remaining ingredients to rice cooker in the order they are listed and stir to mix well.
3. Close rice cooker lid and select white rice setting. Depending on your rice cooker model you will likely need to repeat the cook cycle 2-3 times to cook the ingredients down to a sauce consistency.

### For the Lasagne:
1. Preheat oven to 350°F.
2. Place arugula in a food processor fitted with the "S"-blade and pulse until finely minced.
3. Combine minced arugula, oregano, and basil with cashew cheese and stir to mix well.
4. Add about 1 cup of lentil bolognese sauce to a baking dish and spread to cover the bottom.
5. Place 3 uncooked lasagne noodles on top of the sauce. Leave a little space around each noodle since they will expand.
6. Spread 1/3 of the cashew cheese mixture on top of the lasagna.
7. Spread about 1 1/2 cups of the Lentil Bolognese Sauce over the cheese covered noodles.
8. Sprinkle about 1/4 cup of the mozzarella shreds over sauce, if desired.
9. Repeat steps 5-8 two more times.
10. Place the final 3 lasagne noodles on top of the last layer. Top with remaining sauce and mozzarella shreds.
11. Sprinkle 1/4 cup of vegan Parmesan over the top and cover tightly with aluminum foil.
12. Bake covered for 1 hour and 15 minutes at 350°F or until sauce is bubbling and top noodles appear tender in the center of the pan.
13. Remove foil and bake uncovered for 15 minutes more.
14. Remove from oven and let rest uncovered for at least 15 minutes before serving.
