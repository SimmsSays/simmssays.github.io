# About me
I am currently in my final semester of my last year as an undergraduate. There are three very important things that you should know about me:
1. I love tea, as you can see ^^^
2. I love books, but have unlovingly put them on the back burner whilst I muddle myself through this term
3. I am very unsure about a lot of things in my life, so in to the premise of the blog...


# The premise of the blog
The life of a third year university student can be difficult when trying to
balance everything you want to do, with everything you need to do. From eating
well, to having enough money, working for that money and then managing your
workload, it can be rather difficult, adulting for the first time.

Each week, I'll have a short Q&A with another third year student covering
one important section of our lives and how we find time to make it work, how
much we value it and if there's a way to find that 'imperfect balance' we
always feel is slipping away from us as graduation looms closer.
